The focus of my graduate capstone project was a systems engineering analysis of a hypothetical factory automation solution for LEGO.

This project was largely inspired by the LEGO Group building a new production facility in Virginia, as well as my experience working in a manufacturing environment.

[An article published by JHU about my graduate project can be found here](https://ep.jhu.edu/news/enabling-customized-brick-creations/).
